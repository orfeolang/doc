# Syntax

## Markers

Markers are used to mark specific moments in the score.

They can be used by applications to do things like play only a chosen
section of a score, or add markers in a DAW.

Markers start with the at sign ```@```, and can contain letters,
numbers, apostrophes, underscores, hyphens/minus signs, ahd periods.
Markers cannot finish with an underscore, hyphen/minus sign, nor a period.

```orfeo
    # Allowed characters in various portions of a marker.
@                   # start
a-z A-Z 0-9 ' _ . - # middle
a-z A-Z 0-9 '       # end
```

A marker can be placed anywhere, except before a duration.

```orfeo
    # A marker is disallowed before a duration.
(@myMarker =4/4 a b c d) # Will generate an error.
```

```orfeo
    # Example markers.
@intro
@part-A_section-I
@measure-44b
@-1
@.1
@A'
@A''
```

When an Orfeo file is compiled to Musicline file, the marker appears as
so:

```musicline
0 1 marker intro
```

## Error Messages

In the unhappy event that the compiler encounters an error in your
Orfeo code, it will return an error message designed to help you
solve the problem.

These error messages are always displayed in the same format. Their
goal is to indicate that an error has occured, where it occured, and
what the error consists of.

The first line contains the ```===OOPS!===``` symbol followed by the
error location composed of the line number, the ```:``` separator,
and the character position. \
Ex: ```===OOPS!=== 2:4``` (line 2, character 4)

The second line shows a printout of the entire code line where the
error occurred indicating the precise error point with the eject
icon ```‚èè```.

Finally, The subsequent line or lines describe the error.

Examples:

::: code-group

```[error]
===OOPS!=== 1:12
=4/4 do r√© ‚èèü§ü mi
Unknown token: ü§ü
```

```orfeo [code]
=4/4 do r√© ü§ü mi
```

:::

::: code-group

```[error]
===OOPS!=== 1:3
( ‚èè_4.4.4 )
Malformed rest: _4.4.4
A rest must be a nonnegative number, or a time signature.
```

```orfeo [code]
( _4.4.4 )
```
